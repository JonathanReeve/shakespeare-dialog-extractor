#About this Project
This project modifies the XSLT stylesheets for the Folger Libary Shakespeare TEI XML files to allow for the ability to extract or highlight particular characters' dialog. This is originally intended for use in computational textual analysis. 

#Contents
 * Ham-short.xml is a modified TEI file containing Act I, Scene I of play Hamlet. This shorter version allows for faster testing. 
 * editions.css is a modified CSS file containing custom styling, to make the user interface pretty. 
 * editions.xsl is a modified version of the Folger Library XSL sheet, with additional markup, more explicit class declarations, and other useful transformations that allow for the extraction of dialog.
